# Pac-Man HDNes Pack Demo Screen Fix
In the original version by PepCodes, on the demo screen where the ghost names and point values are shown, Clyde (the right-most ghost) disappears before Pac-Man can eat him. Rerecording the pack via Mesen did not fix this. The reason is that the sprite is changed to background layer and is blocked by the solid black background tile.
